## Other information
**Important point!** Product information is stored on different servers (wildberries), so requests can be to different wilberry servers. The API is based on basket-05.wb.ru. I noticed that the products stored there start with 7. For example, 75240253 or 73512949.
The API can and should be improved, I hope that the code will be interesting to read :)
